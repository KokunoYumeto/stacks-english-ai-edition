# EGA integration log

## 2026-08-07

- [x] Correct the active scope from EGA II to the full EGA 0--IV corpus.
- [x] Create the durable 3,995-character EGA-to-Stacks goal.
- [x] Bind the read-only edition interface to sealed French printed p.19 and
  corrected English discovery manifest R184.
- [x] Repair the validator so a newer live French cursor does not invalidate
  earlier mappings bound to exact historical authority receipts.
- [x] At the first useful mechanical opportunity, launch a nonconservative
  Spark batch. Prefer independent candidate, label, manifest, schema,
  reference, inverse, or build-log shards; scale the batch rather than leaving
  the separate Spark pool idle, but never invent useless work to consume it.
- [x] For the first agent batch, record task IDs/model, exact bounded scope,
  inputs, requested output, runtime/status, returned findings, false positives,
  unexpected writes, independent verification, accepted/rejected disposition,
  visible usage when available, and the exact net effect on owner work. See
  `agent.csv`; the archived task ID is the durable pointer to its verbatim
  prompt and full result.

### Spark batch A000001--A000016

- Five disjoint manifest shards replayed all 127 R184 entries. Every path,
  byte count, and SHA-256 matched. This independently corroborates the owner
  intake replay.
- Receipt, interface, validator, ID, candidate, privacy, inverse, and diff
  audits were consumed. Accepted and rejected findings are separated in
  `agent.csv`; no agent finding was promoted without an owner check.
- Three false-discrepancy patterns were learned and bound for later prompts:
  external authority payloads must be named by exact external path; Stacks
  source labels must be normalized from `file-label` to local `label`; and
  official tags must be checked against `tags/tags`, never `cand.csv`.
- All sixteen tasks reported no filesystem writes. A fresh owner `git status`
  remains mandatory because read-only claims are not self-certifying.
- All sixteen completed Spark tasks were archived only after their results and
  owner dispositions were written to `agent.csv`.

### Statement review A000017--A000019

- Three non-overlapping read-only reviewers covered EGA I 1.1.1--1.1.15.
  Their exact task names, scopes, findings, owner checks, and dispositions are
  recorded in `agent.csv`; runtime telemetry was not exposed.
- The review produced 22 statement edges across 14 source units, eight
  explicit residuals, two exact existing-tag equivalences, and one exact
  locally integrated lemma. The local lemma has deliberately no official tag.
- The 1.1.15 reviewer also detected the printed proof's missing
  `a != A` qualification. The diplomatic French remains untouched; the
  correction is routed through `reports/findings.jsonl`.

Agents may improve throughput or independent checking; they may not decide
source authority, theorem equivalence, mathematical correctness, translation,
visual fidelity, publication, or ownership. The owner verifies every result.

### Spark batch A000020--A000027

- Eight independent audits attacked the new lemma from mathematical edge cases,
  bounded duplicate search, source conventions, use-site logic, provenance,
  statement-map semantics, validator completeness, and bounded build evidence.
- The mathematical and use-site reviews confirmed the implication chain. The
  duplicate audit found no exact named target already present in the Stacks
  source. The source-convention audit found no new formatting defect.
- The provenance review confirmed that F8 is the direct French source receipt
  for the new statement edge and `LOCAL_WORKTREE` describes only the target
  integration state. One reviewer conflated those axes; that detail was
  rejected and is retained explicitly in `agent.csv`.
- The adversarial validator review found genuine blind spots in coverage-value
  validation and relation-to-residual closure. `check.py` now fail-closes on
  those fields and on incomplete or duplicated agent records.
- Bounded serial builds of `algebra.tex` and `more-algebra.tex` completed
  without fatal errors. The new citation and local label resolve. Generated
  build logs remain ignored artifacts and are not part of the public scaffold.
- Every task result was consumed and owner-checked before archival. Exact task
  IDs, runtimes, findings, checks, dispositions, and write claims are recorded
  in `agent.csv`.

### Canonical-source correction referral

- The EGA I 1.1.15 proper-ideal proof qualification was recorded append-only
  as `EGA-I-1.1.15-PROOF-PROPER-IDEAL` in
  `reports/findings.jsonl` and sent to the bounded French-canon task.
- The dispatched file was 777 bytes with SHA-256
  `01B2E4D9AB60A6CAF880DE8EF6D38282ACD80389A4BDEE92C02F700F8AC4E993`.
  This referral proposes a corrected-layer disposition and does not alter the
  diplomatic French authority.
